# INTRODUCTION 




## Objectives

1.	To describe socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients  by age group, pregnancy status, and geographical region .
2.	To describe risk factors for severe disease and death of COVID-19 patients by age group, pregnancy status and geographical region in MSF settings.


# Methedology
## Study area:

This analysis is multi country data analysis of COVID-19 cases treated in MSF. Countries included in this analysis were from five world bank geographic areas, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Europe and Central Asia (ECA), South Asia (SA), Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).

```

## Data collection

In this analysis, we have used data from Covid-19 excel line list developed by MSF-epicentre. The line list was developed based on the WHO and CDC case definitions and was the same line list through out all the countries where MSF was supporting the COVID-19 response. It was deployed to the 41 countries where MSF was supporting the COVID-19 response and data was collected using the CIF developed for the line list. Data collection was optional in most of the countries. Hence, the number of variables routinely collected were different from country to country. 

### Inclusion criteria

In this analysis we have included only confirmed admitted cases of all countries where MSF Work. MSF has been supporting Covid-19 response in 41 countries, of which 34 of the countries have confirmed admitted patients. All countries with any confirmed admitted patients are included in this analysis. Confirmed COVID-19 case were defined as cases which were tested positive on PCR test or rapid test. Admitted confirmed cases were cases managed as inpatients in the MSF supported MSF supported facility.

### Exclusion criteria 

Countries with no case of admitted confirmed cases are excluded from the the analysis. in the regression analysis call cases with missing values if the selected variables for the regression analysis are automatically excluded from inclusion in the regression analysis. Only patients with known outcome were included in the regression analysis and the estimation of the case fatality and mortality rate.

## Statistical software used

We have used R software version 4.1.3 to analyse this data [@rsoftware]. Package gt summary version 1.5.2 was used in most of the descriptive analysis [@gtsummary] and sitrep package from the R4Epis website [@sitrep]. 

## Analysis

Exploratory data analysis was done for the raw data from all the countries. Data was cleaned for inconsistencies and correction of of conditional missing values was done.The data has come with hudge missing values from all countries. Hence, the missing values were treated as missing values, and number of events for each variable of interest is reported.
Descriptive analysis was conducted for for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients based on different  geographic regions according to the world bank, age groups (Categorized), gender, pregnancy and clinical characteristics. We have used the latest World bank geographic region to categorize the countries in to the different geographic regions []. 

Regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. All variables with known relation to COVID-19 patients survival and other variables were tested for any significant relation with COVID-19 mortality in the uni variate and multivariate analysis. All variables with anticipated relation and variables known by literature to have significant relation with the COVID-19 outcome were included in the uni-variate analysis. Patients with known COVID-19 outcome (Died, Cured and Sent back home) were included in the regression analysis. Died patients were coded as 1 (event) while cured and sent back home patients were assigned to 0. Crude odds ratio and p-value were calculated and variables with p-value of 0.25 were passed to the multivariate regression analysis. In addition, variables with known association to COVID-19 outcome but p-value higher than 0.25 were also passed to the multivariate regression models regardless of the the p value.
In the multivariate fitting, many of the variables were automatically excluded from the model due high number of missing values and some variables were excluded by the model due to the contrast error of the minimum cell value after removing the observations with missing values.The AIC value was used to fit the final model of the multivariate analysis using the package stepAIC including both forward and backward methods [].Covariance was checked using the VIF from the gt summary package. 
Model fitness was assessed using the AIC value, Hosmer and Lemshow test and classification table. Finally, con founders were controlled for all existing variables (* many variables have been removed due to missing values) and effect modification was checked.

# Result
## Descriptive analysis of all COVID consultaions

MSF is an international humanitarian organization is working over 70 countries worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, MSF have supported many projects in over 40 counters from case management in hospitals to community activities in COVID-19 prevention and control. We have been collecting COVID-19 data from our health facilities all over the countries we have supported with the COVID-19 case management. Between Jan 2020 to Dec 31st 2021, there were a total of `r nrow(dta_linelist)` COVID-19 consultations in 41 countries where MSF has supported with the control of the pandemic. `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, MSF_covid_status == "Confirmed")` confirmed, `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, MSF_covid_status == "Not a case")` tested negative, `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, MSF_covid_status == "Probable")` probable cases, `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, MSF_covid_status == "Not a suspect")` not suspected after screening.

The highest COVID consultations were from South Asia `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, Continent == "South Asia")` cases followed by middle east `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, Continent == "Latin America & Caribbean")`, Middle east and north Africa `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, Continent == "Middle East & NOrth Africa")` and sub Saharan Africa `r fmt_count(dta_linelist, Continent == "Sub Saharan Africa")` (fig 1, map1).

# Admitted COVID-19 patients
## Socio-demographic  Characteristics

In this analysis, we have included only admitted patients from all missions where MSF has been supporting the COVID -19 centers either alone or in collaboration with the government facilities or other actors. Out of 41 countries where MSF has supported the COVID-19 pandemic control Data form 34 countries (Table 1)is included in this study. Most of the cases were from Syria `r inline_text(Cases_country,variable='Country',level='Syria', column='stat_0')`, Yemen `r inline_text(Cases_country,variable='Country',level='Yemen')` and Iraq `r inline_text(Cases_country,variable='Country',level='Iraq')`. According to the world bank region classification most of the patients included in this analysis come from middle east and north Africa `r inline_text(cases_region,variable='Continent', level='Middle East & North Africa',column='stat_0')` cases followed by Sub Saharan Africa `r inline_text(cases_region,variable='Continent', level='Sub Saharan Africa',column='stat_0')`. Patients included from Europe and central Asia accounts only for 2%.

The Mean and median age of female patients admitted were 47.1 and 48 years respectively, While the mean and the median age of male admitted patients were 48.2 and 48 years old. The smallest median age was in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region, 34 years among the Female and 43 years among the male patients while the oldest median age were from the Latin America and the Caribbeans (LAC) which was 60 years among the female patients and 56 years among the male patients.
the male to female ratio was highest in the ECA region which was 4.4 followed by South Asia (SA) 2.0. the difference between the male and female patients in the ECA region was uniform across all age groups while the difference between male and female patients in south Asia was higher in the age group of 30-39 years old (l45/30).  the over all male to female ratio was 1.4, while the minimum male to female ratio of patients was 1.3 from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (Figure 1).

### Diseases severity and treatment options 

375 (38%) of the critical cases and 880 (40%) of the sever cases seek health care  after 7-13 days of delay. However, Most of the mild and moderate cases were also in the delay of 7-13 days. 
 623 (40%) of the mild cases had stayed for 7-13 days in the hospital compared to only (302)26% of the critical and 932 (29%) of the severe cases. Among the critical cases with oxygen therapy information available,  702 (53%) of the critical cases, 78% of the severe cases, 24% of the Moderate cases and 4.3% of the mild cases were treated with oxygen.  605(46%)of the critical cases and 1181(32%) of severe cases were admitted to ICU. In addition 539 (41%) of the critical cases and 781 (21%) of the sever cases were treated with mechanical ventilation.

# Discussion

This analysis of a large global data set of COVID-19 cases, provides a unique insight into how the pandemic unfolded in humanitarian and low resource settings, where the baseline health needs of the population and their access to healthcare was already challenging.  Inclusion of data solely from MSF supported health facilities, means that data are not representative for each country or region, rather they reflect the situation on the ground in the locations that MSF is actively operating. The  WHO case definitions were used as the basis of data collection and the international MSF linelist, designed to include variables predefined by the WHO and CDC, was adapted to reflect changes in the case definitions as the pandemic evolved [@world2020].  

However, the application of WHO case definitions may have varied by project, based on capacity and access to testing. There were a total of `r nrow(dta_linelist)` COVID-19 related consultations but the number of confirmed patients was 33,093(16%) cases. In many projects with limited access to testing, particularly during the initial phase of the outbreak, most suspected and probable cases were not tested. This might have lowered the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in many of the projects in different countries. Therefore, positivity rates of testing across different contexts or over time have little comparative value. Patient volumes, variations in triage systems in different projects and modifications of case definition for testing by local Ministries of Health, are all likely to have impacted testing practices. Overall, case definitions used locally were aligned with those published by the WHO and therefore the data was considered acceptable for analysis.

From Jan 2020 to Dec 2021, 34 out of the 41 countries where MSF has supported the pandemic response, had COVID-19 patients admitted into health facilities. There were a total of `r nrow(data_linelist)` confirmed admitted COVID-19 patients in these countries, which forms the basis of this analysis. However, access to testing may have affected these numbers as cases in facilities with limited access to  testing, would remain classified as suspected or probable cases. Furthermore differences in admission criteria in a country during different waves of the pandemic, or variations between countries, can distort these numbers.  Among the confirmed admitted patients included in this analysis, 7,172(47%) of the cases were mild cases, 2,974(20%) were moderate cases, 3,666(24%) were severe cases and 1,299(8.6%) were critical cases. Varied clinical practices were observed, where in (EXAMPLE) some countries all suspected and confirmed COVID cases were admitted to isolation facilities regardless of severity particularly during the initial phase of the pandemic, while in others mild cases were sent back home for home based isolation and follow up.

Most of the cases were from Syria `r inline_text(Cases_country,variable='Country',level='Syria', column='stat_0')`, Yemen `r inline_text(Cases_country,variable='Country',level='Yemen')` and Iraq `r inline_text(Cases_country,variable='Country',level='Iraq')`. MSF has a significant presence in Syria and Yemen, due to the humanitarian situations there, and in Iraq MSF operated multiple COVID-19 facilities. 
* context discussion Syria, Yemen and Iraq in middle east...

Of all admitted patients, males represented 8,685(58%) cases whilst females represented 6,309(42%)cases, this is inline with the evidence from many other countries[@peckham2020;@kragholm2021]. The median age of admitted patients  was 48[IQR 32-63] years. There was no sex difference in the age profile of patients admitted, however, the median age of admitted patients was noted to be higher in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Studies have shown variations in the median age with a study from Germany reporting a higher median age of admission for their cohort[@karagiannidis2020] with another from Europe reporting a median age similar to that seen inthis analysis [@ciceri2020]. 

Breathlessness, fever and cough were the commonest symptoms reported across all the countries. This is in line with the established literature, where fatigue/tiredness was also among the most common clinical presentations [@giri2021comparison;@mizrahi2020longitudinal].

The most common co-morbidities in this study were cardiac diseases, hypertension and diabetes across all the geographic regions. 

The case fatality rate of COVID-19 has shown slight variations from the beginning of the pandemic to the later phase with slight decrease in most of the countries [@Caoe043560]. The overall CFR observed in this analysis was 24.1	(23.24–24.97) across all the inpatients. However, there was a significant variation in the CFR across the geographic regions from 6.9 (5.35–8.89) in the SA region  to 32.3	(30.98–33.72) in the MENA countries. The high CFR in this study might be attributable to the contexts in which this data was collected, where access to even oxygen therapy can be challenging, testing might have been rationed for only those worst off. In addition, Many of the cases were reported as probable cases and suspect which was due to lack of testing in most of the projects.However, many modeling analysis have also shown the over all reported COVID-19 mortality was less then the actual deaths bu lacked reporting [@wang2022estimating].

The median age of died patients in this analysis was 64[54-72] years which.Study in new York city has shown median age of mortality 71 years with IQR of (60-89) years old[@kalyanaraman2020].


### Risk factors for COVID-19 mortality 
In this analysis,sex male(AOR=2.2;95% CI of 1.64-2.96),Age group 70-79 (AOR=5.47;95% CI:1.43-36.2) and 80+ (AOR=7.32:95% CI:1.89-49.3) Fever(AOR=3.94,95%CI:2.34-6.9),Cough (AOR=3.39,95% CI: 1.9-6.3), Breathlessness (AOR=2.12,95% CI:1.2-4.2),Renal diseases (AOR=2.66,95%CI:1.3-5.5) were factors significantly associated with poor outcome. However the longer the date of stay in hospital has shown better outcome compared to the patients who have been in admission for less than three days.

studies in SSA (Ethiopia) has revealed factors related to poor treatment outcome including Chronic pulmonary disease (AOR=5.62; 95% CI: 2.49–12.70), asthma (AOR=2.7; 95% CI: 1.17–6.67), CKD (AOR=4.81; 95% CI: 1.27–18.22),diabetic mellitus (AOR 2.27; 95% CI: 1.02–5.09), HIV positive (AOR=10.4; 95% CI: 3.0–36.35),  and age 55 and above years (4.35, 95% CI: 1.30–14.60) [@Kaso2022].
